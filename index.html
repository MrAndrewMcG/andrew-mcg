          <h2 id="toph2">Hi there!</h2>
          <p>My name is Andrew McGoveran, and I put together this site for my application for Theme Specialist. I currently work for Apple as a Genius, helping customers resolve problems with their devices, and completing hardware repairs on Macs and iPhones.  Theme Specialist seems like the perfect opportunity to merge the customer support I have learned at Apple with the web development I have been working on outside of work.</p>

        <h2>HTML / CSS / jQuery</h2>
        <p>I’ve always been passionate about technology, and over the last year and a half I have been building a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. I love that there is always something new to learn, and now I'm hooked on the challenges of front end development.</p>
        <p>For this site I used Flex Box for the layout, and Sass for styling. I used jQuery to add smooth scrolling to the navigation links, to hide and show content, and to bring the buttons to life. Below I've included a few examples to demonstrate what I've been working on over the past few months.</p>
        <div class="button-demo">
          <h3 class="centered">Buttons</h3>
          <p>These buttons use jQuery event handlers when clicked. Check 'em out!</p>
